## Running the server

Assuming `pip3`, `python3` and `yarn` have been installed, and a virtual environment has been established:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jpngfile/crumbs.git
$ . path/to/myenv/bin/activate
(venv) $ ./scripts/install.sh
```

The app should be served on `http://localhost:5000`
